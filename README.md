# Cool People Online

This list serves to collect, in one place, all the cool people whose work and
art I like to follow online.
The idea is to centralize this in one place I own instead of having these be
distributed in rosters of various social network and online services.

I am not planning on adding any automation to keep this list up-to-date.
The names I add here by hand are tested by time and ones I can recall off the
top of my head if I really try.
I don't mean for the list to be a complete list of all the people whose work and
art I follow online, instead, it should be the apex of what I consider top-tier
content online.

I am not yet sure how I will organize the list so I am starting with a single
bullet point list.
It might become a table down the line.

This list is incomplete, I just copied a note from my phone here to kickstart it
but I need to add more of my favorite YouTubers and Twitter and GitHub people.

I will eventually filter down backfill these.
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/TomasHubelbauer/following
- GitHub: https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer (Sponsoring section)

I also have people who I don't really follow but every other year or so come
across their website becase it is linked from Hacker News and every time I tell
myself I need to bookmark it and then never do, or do but then change machines
and don't carry over the bookmars, so I need to add these folks here as well as
I come across them again.
